            Hello, my name is Ryan Jewell. I am an aspiring computer programmer currently studying web design. When
            it comes to wokrking with computers, I always tend to have a very methodical approach, however
            determined I may be to get
            something done as soon as possible. Through college and self teaching I have recently accumulated
            experience working with
            Linux, Java, Python, SQL, C++, and now the fundamental languages of website design: HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript. My favorite hobby will always be torn
            between playing guitar and snowboarding. During the summer months I find myself keeping busy outdoors
            gardening, landscaping and taking pictures on hikes.
